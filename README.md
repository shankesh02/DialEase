# DialEase

This C++ project is a comprehensive phone directory system that incorporates various data structures and functionalities to manage contacts efficiently. It provides users with features such as saving, deleting, searching, and editing contacts.

# Features:
## 1. Data Structures Used:
- **Arrays:** Utilized for sequentially storing contacts.
- **Linked Lists:** Contacts are sorted by creation time, offering a chronological view of contacts.
- **Stacks:** Implemented for efficient deletion operations, allowing easy retrieval of deleted contacts.
- **Binary Search Trees (BST):** Contacts are lexicographically sorted, enabling quick search and retrieval based on names.
## 2. Functionalities:
- **Saving Contacts:** Users can add new contacts, which are stored based on their creation time using linked lists.
- **Deleting Contacts:** Implemented efficiently using stacks to enable easy restoration of deleted contacts if needed.
- **Searching Contacts:** Utilizes the BST structure for quick lexicographical search by name.
- **Editing Contacts:** Users can modify existing contact details as needed.
# How It Works:
- **Arrays:** Serve as a basic storage structure for contacts, allowing for quick access based on indices.
- **Linked Lists:** Contacts are sorted based on creation time, facilitating chronological access.
- **Stacks:** Efficiently handle deletions by storing removed contacts temporarily for potential restoration.
- **Binary Search Trees (BST):** Contacts are organized alphabetically by name, enabling fast search operations.
